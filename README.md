# Front End Bootcamp Module 1 - Challenge 1

## <h1> Code Refactoring </h1>

In this repository, I will refactor starter code provided by my learning provider to demonstrate my understanding and knowledge of HTML and CSS.

I will demonstrate that I understand HTML semantic and non-semantic elements by inputting them within the code where applicable.
